# Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS)

## DREAMv1: Dynamic Reasoning and Evolving Autonomous Mind

HMAS is a sophisticated artificial general intelligence (AGI) framework that implements a hierarchical multi-agent system. At its core is DREAMv1, our AGI engine designed to handle complex tasks through distributed intelligence, dynamic coalition formation, and adaptive learning mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Architecture**: Multi-layered agent organization for complex problem decomposition
- **Distributed Intelligence**: Coordinated problem-solving across specialized agents
- **Adaptive Learning**: Dynamic adjustment of strategies based on experience
- **Scalable Design**: Microservices architecture for horizontal scaling
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast decision-making with parallel processing
- **Robust Security**: Built-in security measures and ethical constraints
- **Extensible Framework**: Easy integration of new capabilities

## Core Modules

1. **Perception**: Multi-modal input processing
2. **Memory**: Distributed knowledge management
3. **Learning**: Advanced machine learning integration
4. **Reasoning**: Logic and decision-making engine
5. **Communication**: Inter-agent messaging system
6. **Feedback**: Performance monitoring and adaptation
7. **Integration**: External system connectivity
8. **Specialized**: Domain-specific capabilities
