"""
Meta-Cognition Module for HMAS Prototype

This module performs intermediate evaluation of the outputs produced by the specialized processing agents.
It uses meta-learning and consensus-based evaluation to verify the consistency and quality of the agent outputs.
This version provides a dummy implementation with a main() function for integration testing.
