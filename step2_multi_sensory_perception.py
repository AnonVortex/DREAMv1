"""
Multi-Sensory Perception Module for HMAS Prototype

This module processes preprocessed data from step1 (Data Ingestion & Preprocessing)
through specialized sensory agents. Each modality (vision, audition, smell, touch, taste)
is processed to extract relevant features. In this simplified version, we simulate the
processing and return placeholder results.
