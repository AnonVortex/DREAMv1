## Overview

The Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS) with DREAMv1 (Dynamic Reasoning and Evolving Autonomous Mind) is built on a microservices architecture that enables scalable, modular, and efficient operation. Each component is designed to be independently deployable while maintaining strong integration capabilities.

## System Architecture
