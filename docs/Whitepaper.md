# HMAS Whitepaper

## Abstract
The Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS) represents a novel approach to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a modular, scalable architecture that combines specialized AI agents with advanced reasoning and learning capabilities. This system is designed to process multi-modal inputs, maintain contextual memory, and adapt through continuous feedback and learning.
