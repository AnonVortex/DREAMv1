# HMAS Roadmap 3-15-2025

## Short-Term (1-2 Months)
- Replace placeholders with production-grade AI models in Perception & Specialized.
- Implement parallel data processing in the aggregator for modules that donâ€™t have dependencies on each other.
- Improve container security (e.g., minimal base images, secrets management).

## Medium-Term (3-6 Months)
- Deploy on a cloud environment (AWS, GCP, or Azure) with Kubernetes.
- Integrate advanced meta-learning in the Meta module.
- Expand Graph RL to handle real-time graph data.
- Implement robust error-handling and auto-retries in the aggregator.

## Long-Term (6+ Months)
- Develop a multi-tenant architecture supporting large-scale data ingestion.
- Integrate advanced multi-agent collaboration strategies, dynamic negotiation, and self-adaptive reconfiguration.
- Explore federated learning or edge deployment for decentralized data sources.
- Ongoing performance tuning and cost optimization in the cloud environment.
