Overview
The HMAS Prototype is an end-to-end hierarchical multi-agent system designed to approach artificial general intelligence (AGI). It processes multi-modal data through specialized agents that collaborate dynamically via a hierarchical structure. The system features an immersive user interface (UI) with a hyperdrive intro, advanced Graph Reinforcement Learning (Graph RL) for combinatorial optimization, and optimized inter-agent communication (communitorial optimization). This documentation outlines the technical details of each component, ensuring clarity for development, maintenance, and intellectual property protection.
