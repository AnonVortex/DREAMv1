## Overview

The HMAS Prototype is an end-to-end hierarchical multi-agent system (HMAS) designed as a step toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The system processes multi-modal data through several layers—from data ingestion, sensory perception, integration into a working memory, to task decomposition, specialized processing (including advanced Graph Reinforcement Learning for combinatorial tasks), meta-cognition, long-term memory, decision aggregation, feedback loops, and monitoring/scalability.

The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and secure, with each module exposing clear APIs. Advanced modules (Graph RL and Communitorial Optimization) are encapsulated and integrated into the pipeline to support dynamic task solving and efficient inter-agent communication.
