Whitepaper: Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS) for AGI
Alexis Soto-Yanez | 2025

1. Abstract
The Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS) prototype introduces an innovative, end-to-end AI framework that leverages multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, and specialized processing to approach artificial general intelligence (AGI). This whitepaper presents the high-level architecture and design philosophy behind HMAS, demonstrating how multiple sensory inputs and processing layers integrate to solve complex, evolving tasks. While the document details key system components and the overall workflow, proprietary methods and unique algorithmic optimizations remain confidential. The HMAS prototype is positioned as a foundational step toward AGI, with built-in protective measures including detailed version control, comprehensive documentation, and legal safeguards.
2. Introduction
2.1 Background & Motivation
Current AI systems excel in narrow domains but struggle to generalize across tasks. The challenge lies in replicating the flexible, collaborative decision-making found in human cognition. HMAS addresses this by employing a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents work in concert. This framework not only enhances adaptability and scalability but also creates an environment where high-level tasks are dynamically decomposed and solved through coordinated, hierarchical collaboration.
2.2 Scope
This whitepaper provides an overview of our HMAS prototype and covers:
A multi-modal data ingestion and preprocessing pipeline.
Perception layers with specialized sensory agents.
Integration modules that fuse sensory data into a unified working memory.
A dynamic task decomposition and routing system.
Domain-specific processing agents for reasoning, planning, and knowledge retrieval.
Meta-cognition and feedback loops for continuous improvement.
A higher-level collaboration framework that organizes agents into teams, organizations, and federations.
Protective measures for intellectual property.
3. System Architecture Overview
3.1 High-Level Components
Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
Ingests diverse data (text, images, audio, sensor inputs) and applies cleaning, normalization, and encoding to prepare it for processing.
Perception Layer:
Employs specialized agents for different sensory modalities (vision, audition, smell, touch, taste) that extract and encode features.
Integration & Working Memory:
Fuses outputs from perception agents into a unified representation stored in a working memory buffer, which is used for subsequent processing.
Task Decomposition & Routing:
A high-level coordinator agent breaks complex tasks into manageable subtasks (e.g., reasoning, planning, knowledge retrieval) and dynamically routes them to specialized agents.
Specialized Processing Agents:
Domain-specific modules handle advanced tasks such as abstract reasoning, planning, and knowledge retrieval. They operate both in parallel and sequentially as required.
Meta-Cognition & Feedback Loop:
Evaluates system performance via meta-learning, using consensus and self-monitoring mechanisms to iteratively refine outputs.
Long-Term Memory & Decision Aggregation:
Archives processed data, learned patterns, and experiences for use in future tasks, while synthesizing final outputs from specialized agents.
Higher-Level Collaboration:
Organizes agents hierarchically—individual agents form teams, teams build organizations, and organizations federate—to tackle increasingly complex tasks.
