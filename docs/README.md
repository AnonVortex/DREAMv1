# Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS)

## Overview
HMAS is an advanced artificial intelligence framework that implements a hierarchical multi-agent system for complex problem-solving. The system combines multiple specialized modules to create an adaptive, learning-driven architecture capable of handling diverse tasks and scenarios.

## Key Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Learning**: Advanced reinforcement learning with multi-agent support
- **Task Generation**: Flexible task creation for various scenarios
- **Environment Simulation**: Physics-based 3D environment with realistic constraints
- **Real-time Visualization**: Interactive GUI for system monitoring and control

### Technical Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Microservices-based design with clear separation of concerns
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Docker containerization with Kubernetes support
- **Real-time Processing**: Efficient pipeline for data processing and decision making
- **Advanced Analytics**: Comprehensive monitoring and performance analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hmas.git
   cd hmas
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

4. Start the system:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Quick Start
1. Access the GUI:
   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```

2. Run a sample task:
   ```python
   python examples/basic_task.py
   ```
