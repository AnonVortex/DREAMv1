# AGI Development Framework - Architecture

## System Overview

The DREAMv1 (Dynamic Reasoning and Evolving Autonomous Mind) framework implements a hierarchical multi-agent system with four levels:

1. **Individual Agents**: Specialized AI models with specific capabilities
2. **Teams**: Collaborative agent groups focused on particular tasks
3. **Organizations**: Functional modules that coordinate teams
4. **Federation**: Complete AGI pipeline orchestrating all components

## Core Architectural Principles

- **Modularity**: Plug-and-play capabilities for all components
- **Containerization**: Microservices for isolation and scaling
- **Resilience**: Redundancy and error handling throughout the system
- **Seamless Integration**: Standardized interfaces between components

## Core Module Enhancements

### Perception
