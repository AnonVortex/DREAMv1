Higher Level Collaboration for HMAS (AGI Prototype)

This script demonstrates how to build higher-level collaborations:
  - Individual AI agents are grouped into Teams.
  - Teams work together to produce unified outputs.
  - Multiple teams are coordinated by an Organization to yield a final decision.
  
This structure mirrors how, in a multi-agent system, teams of specialized agents and
organizations of teams collaborate to achieve a single overarching goal.
