# HMAS Meta Module - Technical Documentation

## 1. Role in the Pipeline
The Meta module is responsible for evaluating and validating the outputs from the Specialized module. It performs system-level analysis, providing verification, consensus, and self-monitoring reports to ensure that the pipeline outputs meet quality and performance criteria.

## 2. Design & Implementation
- **FastAPI Microservice**: Uses an async lifespan context for clean startup/shutdown.
- **Rate Limiting**: Uses slowapi to prevent abuse (default 10 requests/minute).
- **Monitoring**: Exposes Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`.
- **Health & Readiness**: Provides `/health` and `/ready` endpoints.
- **Configuration**: Uses environment variables loaded via `config.py` (overridable by a `.env` file).

## 3. Data Flow
- **Input**: A JSON payload with specialized output, e.g.:
  ```json
  {
      "specialized_output": {
          "graph_optimization_action": 1,
          "graph_optimization_value": 0.98
      }
  }
