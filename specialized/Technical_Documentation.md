# HMAS - Specialized Module (Technical Documentation)

## 1. Role in the Pipeline
The Specialized module processes inputs from the Routing module. It performs domain-specific computations, such as executing a Graph RL algorithm or other specialized tasks, and returns tailored outputs for the Meta module to evaluate.

## 2. Design & Implementation
- **FastAPI Microservice**: Built with an async lifespan context to handle startup and shutdown without deprecated event handlers.
- **Rate Limiting**: Uses slowapi to limit requests to 10 per minute.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics are exposed at `/metrics` for integration with Grafana.
- **Health & Readiness Endpoints**: `/health` and `/ready` endpoints ensure the service is responsive.
- **Configuration**: Environment variables are loaded via `config.py` and optionally overridden by a `.env` file.
- **Logging**: Uses a standardized logging configuration (`logging.conf`) to ensure consistent log formatting.

## 3. Data Flow
- **Input**:  
  The module expects a JSON payload in the following format:
  ```json
  {
      "graph_optimization": "GraphOptimizationAgent"
  }
