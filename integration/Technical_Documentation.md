# HMAS - Integration Module (Technical Documentation)

## 1. Role in the Pipeline
- Receives outputs from Perception (vision/audio, etc.).
- Produces a unified representation (e.g., "fused_features").
- Passes this to the next stage: Routing.

## 2. Design & Implementation
- Built with **FastAPI** + `asynccontextmanager` lifespan for startup/shutdown.
- Uses **Redis** + `slowapi` for rate limiting.
- Integrates **Prometheus** for monitoring at `/metrics`.
- Exposes `/health` and `/ready` endpoints for health checks and readiness checks.

## 3. Data Flow
- **Input** (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "vision_features": "some_vector_representation",
    "audio_features": "some_audio_rep"
  }

## 4. Additional Notes & Future References

- **Container Readiness**: This module is fully containerized with its own Dockerfile. If you prefer a single shared `.env`/logging config across modules, you can unify them later.
- **Test Coverage**: Basic tests exist in `tests/test_integration.py`. When adding complex fusion logic, expand tests to cover edge cases and concurrency scenarios.
- **Advanced Fusion**: The current implementation is a placeholder. You can integrate neural nets, attention mechanisms, or custom algorithms if real data demands more sophisticated merging.
- **Data Persistence**: If partial or short-term storage is needed before routing, consider hooking up Redis or another in-memory DB to store fused data for quick retrieval by downstream modules.
- **Performance & Scalability**: As real data and usage patterns emerge, test throughput (requests/sec) and consider horizontal scaling with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm, along with Prometheus/Grafana for real-time metrics.
