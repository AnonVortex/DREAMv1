Step 5: Specialized Processing Agents for HMAS (AGI Prototype)

This script demonstrates the specialized processing agents that handle the subtasks
routed from the task decomposition stage. The agents include:

- LanguageReasoning: Processes reasoning tasks using natural language and abstract logic.
- PlanningAgent: Develops a plan or sequence of actions.
- KnowledgeRetrieval: Retrieves necessary knowledge from internal or external sources.
- SimulationAgent: (Optional) Performs simulation to refine decision-making.
- SpecializedProcessing: Aggregates results from the above agents.

Each module is implemented with placeholder logic, allowing for future enhancements.
