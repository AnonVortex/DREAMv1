"""
Step 3: Integration and Working Memory for HMAS (AGI Prototype)

This script demonstrates how to fuse multi-modal sensory outputs into a unified
representation, buffer the result for context, and align the data temporally.
The resulting working memory is then available to downstream processing modules.
