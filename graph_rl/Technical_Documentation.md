# HMAS Graph RL Module - Technical Documentation

## 1. Role in the Pipeline
The Graph RL module enhances decision-making by applying reinforcement learning on graph-structured data. It processes inputs (e.g., routing or specialized outputs) and returns a final action decision with a value estimate, contributing to the overall AGI pipeline.

## 2. Design & Implementation
- **FastAPI Microservice**: Uses an async lifespan context for startup/shutdown.
- **Graph RL Agent**: Implemented as a PyTorch model with a simple feed-forward network (expandable to a full graph neural network).
- **Rate Limiting**: Uses slowapi to restrict request rates (default: 10 requests/minute).
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics are available at `/metrics`.
- **Health & Readiness Endpoints**: Provide `/health` and `/ready` endpoints (with a Redis ping for readiness).
- **Configuration**: Environment variables are loaded via `config.py` (with optional `.env` overrides).
- **Logging**: Standardized logging via `logging.conf` is used to track operations and debugging information.

## 3. Data Flow
- **Input**: No specific input payload is required for training in this stub version. In production, this endpoint can be extended to accept parameters or input graphs.
- **Processing**:  
  - The agent processes dummy input data (randomly generated tensors) to simulate training.
  - It runs a short training loop and produces a final action and value estimate.
- **Output**: Returns a JSON object with fields such as:
  ```json
  {
      "action": 2,
      "value_estimate": 0.995
  }
