# Memory Module Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Memory Module implements a sophisticated hierarchical memory system that supports experience replay, efficient retrieval, and memory consolidation. It is designed to work seamlessly with the Learning Agent and other system components.

## Core Components

### Memory Types
1. **Episodic Memory**
   - Stores specific experiences and events
   - Includes success/failure outcomes
   - Maintains temporal relationships
   - Supports experience replay

2. **Semantic Memory**
   - Stores general knowledge and facts
   - Maintains concept relationships
   - Supports knowledge transfer
   - Enables pattern recognition

3. **Procedural Memory**
   - Stores action sequences and skills
   - Maintains performance metrics
   - Supports skill transfer
   - Enables behavior optimization

4. **Working Memory**
   - Temporary storage for active processing
   - Manages current task context
   - Supports decision making
   - Enables real-time adaptation

## Key Features

### Experience Replay Buffer
- Prioritized experience replay
- Importance-based memory management
- Efficient batch sampling
- Automatic buffer size management

### Memory Retrieval
- KNN-based similarity search
- Content-based filtering
- Temporal query support
- Importance-based ranking

### Memory Consolidation
- Automatic importance scoring
- Age-based decay
- Access pattern analysis
- Low-importance memory pruning

## API Endpoints

### POST `/memory`
Store a new memory in the system.
```json
{
    "type": "episodic",
    "experience_type": "success",
    "content": {
        "task_id": "task_123",
        "action": "grasp_object",
        "outcome": "success"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "agent_id": "agent_1",
        "environment": "sim_env_1"
    }
}
```

### POST `/memory/query`
Query memories based on criteria.
```json
{
    "type": "episodic",
    "experience_type": "success",
    "content_filter": {
        "task_id": "task_123"
    },
    "time_range": ["2024-03-01T00:00:00", "2024-03-31T23:59:59"],
    "limit": 10
}
```

### GET `/memory/replay`
Get a batch of memories for experience replay.
```
GET /memory/replay?batch_size=32
```

### POST `/memory/similar`
Find similar memories based on embedding.
```json
{
    "embedding": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...],
    "k": 5
}
```
