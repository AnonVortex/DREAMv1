Initial Commit: Comprehensive HMAS Prototype – End-to-End Multi-Agent System for AGI (Alexis Soto-Yanez)

This commit lays the foundation for our innovative Hierarchical Multi-Agent System (HMAS) prototype. Every component is integrated to form an end-to-end pipeline aimed at approaching AGI. Detailed documentation and version control ensure our work is protected. Key features include:

1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:
   - Multi-modal data feeds (text, images, audio, sensor inputs) ingested via APIs, sensors, and streaming pipelines.
   - Preprocessing modules performing normalization, cleaning, error correction, tokenization (for text), and feature encoding (for images, audio, etc.).
   - Synchronization of multi-modal data for coherent fusion.

2. Perception Layer (Low-Level Agents):
   - Specialized sensory agents for Vision, Audition, Smell, Touch, and Taste.
   - Detailed submodules within each modality (e.g., Vision: color processing, motion detection, depth estimation; Audition: frequency analysis, sound localization, voice recognition; etc.).
   - Generation of high-dimensional feature vectors for subsequent processing.

3. Integration & Working Memory:
   - Fusion module that aggregates outputs from all perception agents using attention mechanisms and multimodal transformers.
   - A working memory buffer that stores and synchronizes integrated features for downstream processing.

4. Task Decomposition & Routing:
   - High-level coordinator that interprets overall tasks.
   - Automated decomposition of complex tasks into subtasks (e.g., reasoning, planning, knowledge retrieval) with dynamic routing.
   - Dynamic reconfiguration based on input complexity and feedback.

5. Specialized Processing Agents (Mid-Level):
   - Domain-specific modules for language & reasoning, planning, and knowledge retrieval.
   - Capabilities for parallel and sequential processing, simulation, problem-solving, and creative generation.

6. Intermediate Evaluation & Meta-Cognition:
   - Meta-learning and reflection modules that review outputs for consistency and context.
   - Consensus-building via voting or weighting mechanisms.
   - Self-monitoring to trigger iterative refinement.

7. Long-Term Memory & Knowledge Base:
   - Persistent storage for processed data, learned patterns, and experiences.
   - Memory retrieval systems that augment ongoing processing with historical context.

8. Decision Aggregation & Output Generation:
   - A central integrator that synthesizes outputs from all agents.
   - Advanced natural language generation (or alternative synthesis techniques) to produce coherent final output.
   - Post-processing, formatting, and error checking for quality assurance.

9. Feedback Loop & Continuous Learning:
   - Robust performance metrics, error logging, and feedback collection.
   - Adaptive model updates using reinforcement learning and fine-tuning.
   - A self-improvement cycle optimizing processing paths and agent assignments.

10. Higher-Level Collaboration:
    - Hierarchical structuring where individual agents form teams, teams build organizations, and organizations federate.
    - Dynamic negotiation protocols where agents update proposals and confidence in real time.
    - Integration of multi-agent collaboration across various levels for unified, robust decision-making.

11. Immersive Intro Overlay:
  - A full-screen Three.js scene with a hollow, wireframe sphere rendered in neon green.
  - The sphere follows the user's cursor smoothly.
  - Orbiting nodes arranged in a circular formation around the main sphere, with connecting neon lines.
  - A dynamic particle system background to enhance the futuristic aesthetic.
  - A custom neon-green cursor trail that follows mouse movements.
  - Integrated Typed.js effect to display dynamic promotional phrases.
  - A hyperdrive effect triggered by clicking the 'Enter Site' button that zooms the camera in, accelerates the orbiting nodes and particles (simulating warp drive), and then fades out the intro screen.

12. - Main Website Prototype:
  - A fully responsive, dark-themed website built with Bootstrap 5.
  - A navigation bar with neon green accents.
  - A hero section, followed by detailed sections for About, Technology, Roadmap, Investors, and Contact.
  - Consistent futuristic styling with a black background and neon green highlights to maintain brand identity.
