Step 8: Decision Aggregation and Output Generation for HMAS (AGI Prototype)

This script aggregates outputs from specialized processing agents along with the meta-cognition
evaluation report to generate a final decision output. The process involves:
  1. Aggregating the specialized outputs and evaluation.
  2. Synthesizing the aggregated data into a coherent format.
  3. Post-processing the synthesized output for clarity and quality.
  4. Performing an error check on the final output.
