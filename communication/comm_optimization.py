"""
Communitorial Optimization Module for HMAS Prototype

This module is responsible for optimizing inter-agent communication and
collaboration across different pipeline steps (e.g., Task Decomposition & Routing,
Specialized Processing Agents). The goal is to dynamically adapt communication
strategies (broadcast, unicast, gossip, etc.) based on performance metrics,
feedback loop data, or real-time negotiation protocols.

In this placeholder implementation:
  - We simulate collecting communication metrics.
  - We pick a strategy from a set of predefined options.
  - We return the chosen strategy for integration with the pipeline.
